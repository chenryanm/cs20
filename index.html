    This is a picture of my favorite place Hawaii, more specificially Maui. <br />
    Maui is my favorite place because I have been going there with my family <br />
    since I was a little kid. I have so many memories of Maui and it has become <br />
    a very special place to me. Whenever I visit I am filled with a great sense
    of relief and relaxation. I love <br /> the beaches, the food, and everything about 
    the island. I cannot wait to go back.

    Something that someone may not expect about me is I have been sewing and pattern drafting for <br />
    the past 10 months learning to make my own jeans. I now commision and make custom jeans for <br />
    people and have been working to outsource and manufacture them for my brand. The jeans <br />
    I wear to class are ones that I made myself! Follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/curation1/" target="_blank"
